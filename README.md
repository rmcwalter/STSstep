Sound Texture Synthesis w/ texture morphs/steps <br>
Writen by Richard McWalter <br>

This version of the sound texture synthesis toolbox is an adaptation/extention of the original version created by McDermott and Simoncelli (2011).  There are a few difference from the original version, which are presented below, in addition to the the inclusion of the ability to synthesize "texture morph" and "texture steps".  Texture morphs are generated from statitsics sampled at points on a line between two textures.  Texture steps are textures that contain changes in statisics at some point during their duration.  Both are described in detail in McWalter and McDermott (2018).
